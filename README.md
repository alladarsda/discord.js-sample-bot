## Warning!
We would highly suggest you to download the source code from [releases](https://github.com/NeotiDev/discord.js-sample-bot/releases) instead of downloading the master branch. Releases are tested in different environments and they've been optimized to work as expected.

Master branch may include some bugs, and the latest commits might not even be tested by NeotiDev at all.

## This has been tested in Discord.js v11.4.2
We already have a local version that is compatible with v12, and we will push it when Discord.js releases v12.

Do note that v12 is a code-breaking update and it may break the whole code.

Please get support from our [Discord server](https://neotidev.com/discord) for further assistance for migrating from v11 to v12.

### Installation Procedure
#### Install Node.js
First you need to have **Node.js** installed on your PC or Server (wherever you will run your bot.) Download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).  

It would take a lot of time for us to teach you how to install **Node.js** on your Operating System, so please learn how to install it first and then come back here.

#### Installing Dependencies
We need to install **Discord.js** library in order to get everything working.  
We are going to do that with **NPM (Node Package Manager)**.  

We already included a **package.json** file that will tell **NPM** which dependencies needs to be installed.  
You need to run ```npm install``` and wait for the dependencies to be installed.

#### Get a token from Discord
You need to navigate to the [Developers Section](https://discordapp.com/developers) of Discord and create an application. The procedure is extremely easy and step-by-step guided, so you shouldn't experience any problems.  

After you have created your application, navigate to the **"Bot"** tab and create a bot account for your application.  
Copy the token and add it to **config.json** of the bot files you downloaded.

### Run the application
Run Node.js client, navigate to the folder that you downloaded the files and type `npm start` or `node app.js`.  
You're ready to go!
