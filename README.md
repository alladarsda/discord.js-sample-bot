### Installation Procedure
#### Install Node.js
First you need to have **Node.js** installed on your PC or Server (wherever you will run your bot.) Download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).  

It would take a lot of time for us to teach you how to install **Node.js** on your Operating System, so please learn how to install it first and then come back here.

#### Installing Dependencies
We need to install **Discord.js** library in order to get everything working.  
We are going to do that with **NPM (Node Package Manager)**.  

We already included a **package.json** file that will tell **NPM** which dependencies needs to be installed.  
You need to run ```npm install``` and wait for the dependencies to be installed.

#### Get a token from Discord
You need to navigate to the [Developers Section](https://discordapp.com/developers) of Discord and create an application. The procedure is extremely easy and step-by-step guided, so you shouldn't experience any problems.  

After you have created your application, navigate to the **"Bot"** tab and create a bot account for your application.  
Copy the token and add it to **config.json** of the bot files you downloaded.

### Run the application
Run Node.js client, navigate to the folder that you downloaded the files and type `npm start` or `node app.js`.  
You're ready to go!
